# Microservices-Traversy-CrashCourse

This is a repository for the Microservices Crash Course by Traversy Media on YouTube.

You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEDT4lWWe9g).

It is just a simple example of how to create microservices using Node.js and Moleculer.

All of the data is hardcoded and there is no database.

It's just a simple example, the services are not really functional. They are just there to show how to create microservices.

## Services

1. User Service - Create, find users
2. Auth Service - Login
3. Email Service - Send email

Note: The services are not connected to each other. They are just separate services.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Run `npm run start` to start the server
